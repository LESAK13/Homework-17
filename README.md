# Homework-17

For this assignment, it was necessary to create a workout tracker.  All of the front end code was provided, so it was required to create a Mongo database, schema and create the routes.

I structured a workout model that matches the data in the seed.js file.  I also created a server.js file along with html routes and api routes.  Lastly, I set up the mongo database and created the collection.  I am able to navigate to the workouts collection in the workout database and return all the seeded information.

When I run the server the last workout is fetched from the api and presented to the user.  However, I was not able to get the other routes to work.

I will continue to work on this assignment, but wanted this submitted before grading.
